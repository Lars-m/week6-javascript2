# JavaScript(p2), DOM, AJAX, JSON + an introduction to the Single Page Architecture

## Before the start of this period you should:
You can do with NetBeans only for this period, but I (very much) suggest you install node and a new JavaScript editor, to prepare yourself for period 3 (and make this periods JavaScript a bit more fun/realistic)
- Install Node (important, install the LTS-version): https://nodejs.org/en/download/ 
- Install a new editor/IDE for JavaScript development. We suggest Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/download 
- Install [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) (If not already done) before wednesdays lecture (Ajax)


### Tuesday - JavaScript continued
User defined Callbacks, this in JavaScript, Constructor Functions, ES6 and how to use it, closures, var and hoisting.

### Wednesday - Ajax, JSON, fetch and DOM continued
An introduction to Ajax and JSON, via fetch and how to use it with a REST-API Backend

### Thursday - Single Page Applications
An introduction to the Single Page Architecture, and how to write Single Page Applications with plain JavaScript


## Learning objectives
- Learn the fundamentals of modern JavaScript, including features from ES6.
- Learn how to create modern pages than can update the DOM, with no need to refresh the whole page, using plain JavaScript DOM manipulationn
- Get a basic understanding of the term Single Page Application, and how it differs from server-side rendered app's as introduced on 2. Semester.

## Business competences

JavaScript is one of the most demanded programming skills (ref: [it.jobindex.dk](https://it.jobindex.dk/jobsoegning?q=javascript&supid=1) ).

JavaScript this semester will provide students with the background to join modern front-end teams, using JS and supplementing JS frameworks/libraries.
